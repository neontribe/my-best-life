  ### Special categories of data


  The General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) recognises certain categories of personal information as sensitive, and therefore requiring more protection. These categories of data include information about your health, ethnicity, and political opinions.  In certain situations, we may collect and/or use special categories of data. We do not ask for special category data, but in certain situations we might. If so, we will only process these special categories of data if there is a valid reason for doing so and where the GDPR allows us to do so.

  ## Lawful processing


  We are required to have one or more lawful grounds to collect and use the personal information that we have outlined above. We consider the grounds listed below to be relevant:


  ### Consent


  Where you have provided your consent for our use of your personal information in a certain way, for example where we ask for your consent to speak to you about our experience of the web app.


  ### Legal obligation


  Where the processing of your personal information is necessary for us to comply with a legal obligation to which we are subject, for example where we have to share your personal information with regulatory bodies which govern our work.

  Where it is necessary for us to process your personal information in order to perform a contract to which you are a party (or to take steps at your request prior to entering a contract).


  ### Legitimate interests


  Where applicable law allows us to collect and use personal information on the condition that to do so is reasonably necessary for our legitimate interests (and the use of your personal information is fair, balanced, and does not unduly impact your rights). We may rely on this ground to process your personal information when we believe that it is more practical or appropriate than asking for your consent. For instance, we rely on the legitimate interest ground to process your personal data

     Please note that certain countries outside of the UK have a lower standard of protection for personal information, including lower security protections. Where your personal information is transferred, stored, and/or otherwise processed outside the UK in a country which does not offer an equivalent standard of protection to the UK, we will take all reasonable steps necessary (such as entering into standard contractual clauses to protect your personal information) to ensure that the recipient implements appropriate safeguards designed to protect your personal information. If you have any questions about the transfer of your personal information, please contact us using the details at clause 13.

However, we will remove your personal information from our records before this date if we become aware that (a) your personal information is no longer required in connection with such purpose(s); (b) we are no longer lawfully entitled to process it; or (c) you validly exercise one of your right of erasure under clause 10.
