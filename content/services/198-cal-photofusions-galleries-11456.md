expectation: >
  The workshop will have at least one hour of structured physical activity
  through photgraphy, games etc.  These workshops aim to demonstrate how
  creativity can be used to improve health and wellbeing by using photography
  and graphics as the primary tool. Each session, a different artistic technique
  will be demonstrated and practised, so that participants can experience a
  range of skills to try out.  

  During each session, information about mental health and healthy eating will be presented and discussed in the group, whilst undertaking the activity which will allow for a space where participants can be creative, social and share ideas. 

  Part of summer school we will be providing lunch for all participants.
