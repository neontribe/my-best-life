  - comment: "“Jenni Steele has a vision on how a community should support each
      other. The biggest experience for me was seeing how impactful being a
      young role model is to my community. I really enjoyed speaking on my
      journey. I was able to share with the kids real life’s truths. Life isn’t
      easy but you have to keep going. Congratulations on your tour Jenni. Long
      may it continue.” "

      go for it, because what have you got to lose?\" "
