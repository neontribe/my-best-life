  Children will be served meal that meets School Foods Standards.
  We will show and educate the children about types of food categories and how much of each they need each day. We will allow the children to help with the preparation and cooking of healthy lunch. 
  
  The aim will be for them to understand exactly what they are eating and how it benefits their body.
  We will also allow kids to engage in various different sports such as basket ball, table tennis, lawn tennis and football. We will allow the children to choose which one the prefer from these options. 
  
  We will also give them the opportunity to change the sports if they want to.
  We shall also deliver a trip to South Kensington Science Museum.
