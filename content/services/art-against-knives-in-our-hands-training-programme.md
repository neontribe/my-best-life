quotation: I never thought that coming to Dollis Dolls would become a weekly
  ritual for me, but after a while I stopped coming with the intention of just
  doing nails, I came to interact with the new family that I had made. Being
  around such amazing people taught me to be myself, to open up more, and that
  home is not just where you lay your head to sleep at night.
