reviews:
  - comment: I never thought that coming to Dollis Dolls would become a weekly
      ritual for me, but after a while I stopped coming with the intention of
      just doing nails, I came to interact with the new family that I had made.
      Being around such amazing people taught me to be myself, to open up more,
      and that home is not just where you lay your head to sleep at night.
