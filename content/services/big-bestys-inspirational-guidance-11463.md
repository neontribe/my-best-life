Participants are welcomed Monday to Friday from 9:30am to practice their starter challenges. The football programme which officially commences at 10am will engage CYP in exciting, fun and developmental activities and football matches throughout the day. The activities provide a lot of physical exercise, and through challenging team challenges, also provide a platform for CYP to exercise their brains with ‘stretchy’ learning, which develop resilience.

Through BiG’s popular points system, CYP will develop key personal, social and transferable skills such as team working and will be educated about healthy lifestyles including nutrition.

Suitable for children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities.
