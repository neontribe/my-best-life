  Enrol for our 2 programmes in 1 holiday activity - a football programme for
  children and young people (CYP) between 7 and 13 years old, and work
  experience opportunity for teenagers between 14 and 16 years
  old.   Participants are welcomed Monday to Friday from 9:30am to practice
  their starter challenges. The football programme which officially commences at
  10am will engage CYP in exciting, fun and developmental activities and
  football matches throughout the day. The activities provide a lot of physical
  exercise, and through challenging team challenges, also provide a platform for
  CYP to exercise their brains with ‘stretchy’ learning, which develop
  resilience.

  Through BiG’s popular points system, CYP will develop key personal, social and transferable skills such as team working and will be educated about healthy lifestyles including nutrition.

  Suitable for children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities.
