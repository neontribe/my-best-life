All sessions are free and catered towards 11 to 18yr olds, food and refreshments will be provided. Some sessions will be held at Larkhall Park, contact us for more details.

We're operating from both Dexters Adventure Playground and Larkhall Park. Instagram - Bigkidfoundation Twitter - BIGKIDCharity. When attending sports sessions we would recommend wearing appropriate trainers (Larkhall Sessions require plastic studded boots)."
