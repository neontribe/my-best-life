description: "Access to free condoms in lots of places (called Outlets) across
  London. Confidential service. The first time you visit, you'll speak with a
  trained advisor who will explain how the scheme works and run through the
  importance of using condoms to avoid STIs and pregnancy. They will also make
  sure you know how to use a condom correctly. Advisors can also answer
  questions you may have. Once you’ve met an advisor, you’ll be given a card so
  that you can collect condoms or get advice - just look for any Outlet
  displaying the Come Correct logo. "
