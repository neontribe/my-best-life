  sound audio and stunning visuals. Cinema guests can be treated to a red carpet
  experience and venture to the rooftop space for entertainment, live music,
  vegan food, drinks and a designated 'Chill Zone' (to play a board game, read a
  book or socialise). Complimentary popcorn will be served out to guests.
