  - comment: You're never to old to learn something new! But forget youtube
      tutorials, I had a good few hours at Grooveschool learning the basics and
      after just one session I was able to go away and put together my first
      mix! Thanks I'll be back soon

  - comment: As friends with a similar interest in house music, we wanted to learn
      to DJ together back-to-back. Our aim being to learn the basic techniques
      of DJing + put a mix together. Through the few sessions we have had with
      Richie so far, we feel we've made progress — now understanding the basics
      better and having a clear foundation on which to build upon. We're now in
      the process of putting the mix together and look forward to continuing our
      work on this. As one of us is also blind, we were looking for a DJing
      instructor who would be able to take account of this, understanding the
      accessibility issues surrounding it and coming up with solutions. Richie
      has been extremely helpful in this regard — recommending the most
      appropriate equipment for us to practice with.”
