expectation: "Health & Wellbeing Practitioners (HWPs) offer 3 months’ worth of
  sessions to eligible young people. They can support you to identify one or two
  goals to work towards and then plan future sessions around these. All sessions
  are informal and friendly; some may involve watching videos, worksheets or
  practical tasks. Your HWP might suggest new challenges or ways of managing
  difficulties for you to try outside the sessions, to help you notice and make
  changes. Your HWP may also talk to you about new activities or local services
  that could help you gain confidence, new skills and connections. HWPs often
  connect young people with mentoring, sports and creative activities. Some of
  the team can also provide advice on housing support, education and training
  options. "
contactExplanation: "Fill in the online form to register for an appointment. If

  of booking. The HWP team runs a variety of groups throughout the year on
  various topics; current group information is posted on the news page and on
  social media, so get in touch if you see something you would like to take part
  in. "

  - comment: The people at the Well Centre always make you feel at home and when you
      enter it’s like your troubles float away… It was really nice because you
      didn’t just have to talk about what mental health issues you had, you
      could talk about your favourite movie or what you did on the weekend… By
      coming to the Well Centre I have progressively become a lot happier with
      myself and others. I would truly recommend going to the Well Centre.

  - comment: When I first came to The Well Centre, I was nervous as I am not used to
      opening up to people, especially strangers so it was hard at first but the
      Well Centre Youth Worker, who I saw every 2 weeks, helped me by listening
      to my problems and giving suggestions as to how to deal with them in the
      best possible way. She was very supportive and friendly, making it
      comfortable for me to talk to her. The doctors at The Well Centre were
      also helpful with how to deal with my low moods and motivation. By coming
      to The Well Centre I began to think more positively rather than jumping to
      the worst scenario when I get anxious, and slowly push myself and work on
      myself and build my confidence. I have also begun to speak up about my
      problems with my family rather than keeping it to myself.
