  - comment: I came to Sasha with a passion and to seek some business advice. I have
      received a lot more than I bargained for because working with Sasha has
      helped me turn what was simply a hobby into a business. What has impressed
      me the most is that Sasha has taken the time to understand who I am and
      what motivates me so that this can be translated into the business.
