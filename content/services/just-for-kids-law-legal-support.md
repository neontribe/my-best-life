  They communicate with the police to stop young people being held in custody
  and seek alternative ways of dealing with a case before charges are brought. 


  They represent young people when they are being questioned by the police and advise them on their options. When a court case can't be avoided, they provide representation to young people to ensure their voices are heard, their rights respected, and the best outcome for their case is secured.


  They have particular expertise in assisting clients who have special needs and disabilities, including autism, helping them to overcome communication difficulties and ensuring they are listened to.
