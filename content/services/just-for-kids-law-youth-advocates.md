quotation: As a young person you don’t really know who to contact when you have
  an issue. Some organisations can’t provide for all needs, but Just for Kids
  Law can, which was extremely helpful. I don’t know what I would do without
  JfKL.
access: You can get in touch to tell us you need help via phone, email or an
