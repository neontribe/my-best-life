  The information you give will go to a staff member who will read it to see if
  they have all the information they need. If they need any more information,
  they will get in touch with you as soon as possible using the contact details
  you give them. 


  When they have all the information they need, their team will work out whether they can help. They will try to do this as quickly as possible, but it could take up to 3 working days.  Once they have made a decision, they will contact you to let you know whether they can help. If they canâ€™t, they will give you contact details for other services who may be able to help. 


  If you have any questions, just email or call again.
