description: >-
  For those directly affected by gang-related violence, sexual grooming,
  exploitation, domestic violence and abuse. Support if you've witnessed
  domestic abuse or are in a borderline unhealthy relationship. Help to get out
  of sexual exploitation. 


  Time to talk about your issues, away from the outside world. Be inspired by motivational speakers and careers advice. Support to build resilience and establish coping mechanisms. Help to recognise and accept your self-worth, build your confidence, and recognise risky situations so you don't find yourself in an unhealthy relationship. 


  The programme works with statutory agencies (and referral agencies) to further support you.

  - comment: Jenni Steele has a vision on how a community should support each other.
      The biggest experience for me was seeing how impactful being a young role
      model is to my community. I really enjoyed speaking on my journey. I was
      able to share with the kids real life’s truths. Life isn’t easy but you
      have to keep going. Congratulations on your tour Jenni. Long may it
      continue.
