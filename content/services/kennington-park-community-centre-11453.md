description: "KPCC and our partners, Simply Smiley Productions, will be offering a programme of fun and creative activities 4 days a week for 5 weeks this summer. A free, healthy hot lunch, cooked on-site, as well as fruit and snacks, will be provided every day; and at the end of the week children will be invited to ‘shop’ for food kindly donated by the Felix Project to take home with them. 

Activities will include hula-hooping, karate, yoga, drama, dressing up, dance, arts and crafts, and much more! Our kids love growing and eating healthy plants, so this summer we have a Living Wall project. On top of that, we are planning to introduce the children to Shakespeare’s Midsummer Night’s Dream with the help of professional theatre companies. We are also planning to walk the children across the Park to Kennington Park Centre Adventure Playground and take the bus to Max Roach and Slade Gardens adventure playgrounds.

Suitable for children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities.

Many of our staff and volunteers are professional actors and creatives, and love creating exciting and imaginative activities with the children. Our families are keen to come back every holidays and we always have a waiting list. KPCC is where kids make friends, learn new stuff, and enjoy tasty, healthy food, eating together at the table and learning about nutrition, as well as having oodles of fun dressing up, dancing and creating their own plays, stories and everlasting memories.
