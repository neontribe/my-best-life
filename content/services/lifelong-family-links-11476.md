  Well-being, bowling, swimming, football, gym work, boating at Crystal Palace
  Boating Lake and adventure playground sessions at Willington Road. We will
  also offer fruit picking sessions and visits to Godstone Farm where
  participants will be encouraged to interact with the animals. In addition to
  our trained play staff, we will be using trained disability sports coaches
  from Active Living, Disability Sport Coach and Lambeth Sport.

  Our sessions are fun and safe for disabled young people we will pick up and drop off young people.We will also offer practical cooking and baking sessions. In addition, we will lead and encourage discussions on healthy lifestyles. In recognition of the importance of healthy eating to SEND young people in particular, we will also offer advice to participantsâ€™ parents/carers on providing nutritious and low-cost food.
