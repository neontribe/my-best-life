  For all enquiries get in touch via phone or email. You must be registered
  before you attend. This can be done online, or you will be given a form to
  take home when you first arrive. 


  This must be filled out by a parent/carer and returned to the playground on the next day you attend. An open-access policy means you can come and go on your own unless an arrangement has been made with your carer.
