reviews:
  - comment: The experience you gain is invaluable, from working with LPO players to
      talking to panels with artists like Sheku Kanneh-Mason and Angel Blue, and
      going to the office to see what goes on behind the scenes was amazing!

      world.

  - comment: It’s really useful working with my mentor... the way he approaches
      orchestral excerpts is really interesting for me to see, as he’s the one
      who actually plays them in the orchestra professionally.
