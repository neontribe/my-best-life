reviews:
  - comment: Without the support from MindOut my life would have spiralled out of
      control! My advocate has helped me stay on top of things, my life has
      really changed, he has saved my life!
  - comment: My advocate helped me â€“ over and above.  I was listened to and heard
      and what I was going through was not invalidated.
