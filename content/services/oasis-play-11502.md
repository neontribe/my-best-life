  Oasis Nature Garden, a wild greenspace with a meadow, allotment, woodland,
  treehouse, climbing wall, ponds and a small indoor classroom. Everyday there
  will be activities such as pond dipping, arts and crafts and cooking for every
  one to join in with.  

  Free play is encouraged and children explore the garden, devising their own games and making new friends.

  Oasis Nature Garden is a peaceful space for both wildlife and children. There is lots of space to explore and fun activities to choose from. The mud kitchen is a favourite and the treehouse is great for jumping from!  In the woods there is a fire pit for cooking and hidden at the end of the garden  is a climbing wall and swing bridge!


  There's lots of fresh vegetables grown at the garden which can be harvested, cooked and eaten! and it all takes looking after so learning gardening skills is a must! It's fun to be outdoors in an exiting but safe space with lots of new things to do and new friends to be made!
