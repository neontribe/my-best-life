expectation: >
  Routes at Omnibus Theatre is a chance to create your very own play, working
  with a group of other young people, based on whatever story you want to
  tell.  At the end of the week, you will perform the play you have created in
  our theatre, with lighting, sound and costume. Each day you will also join us
  for a tasty breakfast and lunch, including a pizza party on the final day!
