  Free places to eligible children as part of Lambeth's Summer of Food and Fun programme. 

  Our project is ideal for young people experiencing circumstances of hardship where they can access and enjoy activities that perhaps, for many would not be attainable.

  The Workshops and Sport are delivered in a safe environment and with encouragement and support. Together these will improve talents, physical and mental well-being, and a healthier lifestyle.

  The projects offer some an alternative to young people being involved in anti-social conduct and crime, or perhaps being a victim of crime. The projects are an ideal non-confrontational platform for both police officers and young people to meet. This often helps develop harmony from both sides.

  Discovering new skills and understanding within the project workshops can be a foundation stone for future personal development and maybe a route out of deprivation and a road to employment and self-esteem.
