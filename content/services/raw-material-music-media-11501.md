  Calling all ballers and music lovers! 
  A brand new course is coming this summer that will have you doing kick ups and turning up the bass.
  
  Perfect Pitch is a project which explores youth culture through the lens of music and football. 
  
  Using your love for football and favourite music genres, you will merge the two to create a piece of music that is central to your identity and cultural experiences.
