reviews:
  - comment: The LIT program I believe has been paramount to making me stand out to
      the other numerous students my age. This is something I have proudly put
      on my CV and personal statement. Entering work, especially the industry of
      engineering which I wish to go into, is becoming ever more competitive and
      opportunities like the LIT program is something that will help me become
      more hireable.
