  The speed with which your call is answered can depend on the number of
  volunteers available. Switchboard aims to have more volunteers on shift in the
  evenings and at weekends, when demand is higher. 


  When you call, you are placed in a queue. If your call isn't answered, ring back. You won't be able to leave a message, and Switchboard can't return calls. 


  Calls are free for anyone with minutes and cost the same as calls to 01 and 02 numbers with credit. If you would prefer you can use the Instant Messaging service on the Switchboard website or email the Switchboard.
contactExplanation: Call the helpline between 10am and 10pm any day of the week.
