description: "You're matched with a mentor and have a one-to-one session with
  them each week. It's meant to be a positive environment where you feel safe
  and encouraged. Mentors act as role models and help you develop your
  motivation and improve your confidence and self-esteem. Mentors provide
  academic support. Together with your mentor, you set goals related to personal
  development and academic achievement. You can both attend regular Heroinesâ€™
  Workshops which explore different virtues. "
