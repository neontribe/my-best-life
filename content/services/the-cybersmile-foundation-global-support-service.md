  Expert help for a wide range of online-related issues. Get the help you need
  tailored to your situation. Online advisors work around the clock. Many have
  experienced online problems themselves, so they know what you're going
  through. You and your advisor will work together to find ways for you to deal
  with the experience and move on from it. 


  Once you feel ready, you'll both work out next steps, which can include referral for further emotional, practical or legal support from Cybersmile's approved network. If you need ongoing help, Cybersmile will support you until you feel ready to go it alone. 


  This is NOT a crisis support service.

  Reach out to the trained support team via email. The email should contain as
  much information about your problem as possible - so include evidence of
  cyberbullying, online abuse or harassment - as this could be needed at a later
  date. Due to a very high demand, there can be a wait before being allocated an
  advisor. Your enquiry will be assessed by the global support team, and a
  trained advisor will be allocated to help you. The advisor will make contact
  and start providing you with advice. 


  Alternatively, you can use Cybersmile Assistant, the AI-driven smart assistant, by clicking the blue logo icon on the bottom right of the website.

      is amazing and I have beat the cyber bullies all because of you. Never be
      afraid to contact Cybersmile because they will always send you a smile
      back! The advice and help is brilliant and I highly recommend them to
      anyone who is being cyber bullied.
