description: "Expert help for a wide range of online-related issues. Get the
  help you need tailored to your situation. Online advisors work around the
  clock. Many have experienced online problems themselves, so they know what
  you're going through. You and your advisor will work together to find ways for
  you to deal with the experience and move on from it. Once you feel ready,
  you'll botk work out next steps, which can include referral for further
  emotional, practical or legal support from Cybersmile's approved network. If
  you need ongoing help, Cybersmile will support you until you feel ready to go
  it alone. This is NOT a crisis support service. "

reviews: [{author: 'Abigail', comment: "You have helped me so much. The support you have given me in the
  past is amazing and I have beat the cyber bullies all because of you. Never be
  afraid to contact Cybersmile because they will always send you a smile back!
  The advice and help is brilliant and I highly recommend them to anyone who is
  being cyber bullied."}]
contactExplanation: "Reach out to the trained support team via email. The email should
  contain as much information about your problem as possible - include evidence
  of cyberbullying, online abuse or harassment - as this could be needed at a
  later date. Due to a very high demand, there can be a wait before being
  allocated an advisor. Your enquiry will be assessed by the global support
  team, and a trained advisor will be allocated to help you. The advisor will
  make contact and start providing you with advice. "
