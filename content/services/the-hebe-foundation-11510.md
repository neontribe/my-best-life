  Want to spend your summer developing ‘you’ and having fun too? Over the course of four weeks, you can enhance your skills and abilities and shape your future. Through a series of Apprentice-style team challenges, you’ll learn everything you need to know about business & leadership, and you might just be crowned the winner and win the prize too. 
  
  Get involved and find out more about the digital tech world with social media companies like Tiktok & FOUND. All that plus mentoring and career advice, along with paid work experience.
  
  Priority will be given to those who are not in education, employment or training.
  This programme takes place in Clapham & Norwood.
