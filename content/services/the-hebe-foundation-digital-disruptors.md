reviews:
  - comment: "\"I really enjoyed the programme. All the workshops were interesting
      and informative and I learnt much more than I thought I would. Not just
      about adverts, which is what initially came to my mind when I thought of
      'digital marketing', but about film-making, storytelling, and even colour
      psychology. My favourite part of the programme was definitely the final
      pitch. ... I realise now how many careers there are in the digital
      marketing field, and although I’m still not completely sure about the path
      I’m going to take, it’s been an invaluable insight into the industry. It’s
      shown me that entrepreneurship and changing the community around me isn’t
      as difficult as it seems. ... If you want to build your confidence and use
      your creativity while developing a digital solution that will help others
      around you, go for it!\""
