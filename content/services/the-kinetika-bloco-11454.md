description: "The Junior Summer School will see 100 young people come together to learn either drums, steel pans, brass or woodwind. Over the 5 days the young people will learn tunes and develop skills together and on the final day perform a carnival showcase. 

Young people do not need any experience to sign up for drums or steel pans, but need to have access to an instrument and know the basic notes to join brass or woodwind.

The course is free, however you are welcome to give a donation of Â£15 if you are able to.

To sign up please register at www.kinetikabloco.co.uk/join-us by filling in the form.

Participating in Junior Summer School is a great way to develop your creative skills in an instrument and also develop your social skills as you come together with 100 other young people. There will be opportunities for games, team building, health and wellbeing sessions and lots of FUN! You also get to perform to your friends and family at the end of the week sharing all of the amazing tunes you have learnt together."
