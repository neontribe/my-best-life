description: "Is your child:

- Entitled to free school meals
- between the ages of 8 to 16 years old
- a Lambeth resident?

If the answer to all the questions above is yes then we have limited free places available at the Whippersnapper Summer playscheme  which is funded by Lambeth HAF

Everyday Whippersnappers will offer the children a menu of physical activities that young people can choose from. Activities can include;

- Swimming
- Dance
- Yoga
- Zumba
- Outdoor games in the park i.e. rounders, obstacle races, football, basketball, and tennis.

We will also encourage the young people ages 14 to 16 to lead in the activities if they have relevant skills in sports or physical activity with support from our playworkers.

Suitable for children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities.
