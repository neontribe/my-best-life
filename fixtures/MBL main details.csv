The projects offer some an alternative to young people being involved in anti-social conduct and crime, or perhaps being a victim of crime. The projects are an ideal non-confrontational platform for both police officers and young people to meet. This often helps develop harmony from both sides.

Discovering new skills and understanding within the project workshops can be a foundation stone for future personal development and maybe a route out of deprivation and a road to employment and self-esteem.
