We are part of the international Steiner/Waldorf school movement and have a very supportive ‘sister school’, The Hamburg–Harburg Waldorfschule in Germany. 

As Steiner Waldorf teachers we strive to recognise and nourish the individuality that lives within each child. A consciously developed teacher-child relationship and the creation of the harmonious social organism within the class allows the rich Steiner Waldorf curriculum to meet and stimulate the children as they grow through each particular stage of development.

As Waldorf teachers we also endeavour to nourish the sense of wonder and reverence that children bring with them into life – gifts so often undermined by the pace and pressures of modern existence. We strive for high standards of work and behaviour and recognise that alongside an all-round ability and the self-confidence to participate fully in life, children should also take from their school a moral sense of gratitude and responsibility for the earth and for their fellow human beings.

Given the open access nature of the farm, it would be very easy to dismiss VCF as simply being a cute place to visit and ‘all about the animals’.  Behind the public face, the reality is that our animals, whilst much loved, are essentially a vehicle for education and change; the animals feature in many of our programmes and are key to helping our staff and volunteers engage with and deliver positive impact for both individual beneficiaries and groups from our wider community.

Our vision is a city where people from all communities are empowered to experience nature to enhance their health, well-being, and life chances and we use the setting of our urban farm to provide a wide range of educational, recreational and therapeutic support programmes and activities that:

• Support children and disadvantaged people to boost their confidence and aspirations via the development of personal, social, life and practical skills
• Promote emotional, mental, social and physical health and well-being
• Develop environmental awareness and action
• Strengthen community cohesion
• Create enjoyment and recreational opportunities for those from our local and wider communities

These take place during the Easter Holiday (2 week) and Summer holiday (4 weeks). Our primary objective is to provide our young people with entertaining and educational activities to take part in, while giving their parent/carers the opportunity to attend to their other responsibilities knowing that their young people are being properly cared for.

Listed below are just a few of activities we have already done on some of our previous playschemes:
Go-Karts (motorised), Dance/Drama workshop, Museums, Arts workshops, Cinema, Music workshops, Parks, Dressing up, Adventure playgrounds, Pampering, Horse riding, Swimming, Farm visits, Football, Story telling workshops, Cooking, Seaside (Outings) and Much much more...

Each young person is to arrive with enough food and drink (that does not need heating as we may be on an outing and not have access to a kitchen) to last them the whole day.

If your young person uses incontinence pads, send in enough to last the whole day. Also send in a change of clothes in case they have an accident.

Please always dress your child in clothing appropriate to the weather forecast of the day. For hot weather, please put sun cream on your young person (we cannot do this), before sending them in as outside play is a very important part of the routine. Also please send them in with sun hats.

We provide transport for our play schemes. We start picking up the young people from 8am and drop them home from 3.30pm onwards. However you, the parent/carer, must be there to bring them to the bus and collect them off from the bus

While they are with us, your children will be supervised by our team of trained and experienced staff and volunteers.

Play scheme places fill up extremely quickly so booking forms need to be handed to the office as soon as possible, alongside FULL payment before your place can be booked for the playscheme you are trying to secure a place for your child.

Bullying behaviour can take many forms, often in combination – such as verbal, physical, emotional or cyberbullying. Bullying is a child protection issue by law, and we all have a legal duty to keep children safe from bullying and harm.  

Bullying is devastating for young lives. Anxiety, depression, self harm and suicidal ideation are common amongst children who experience bullying, and the negative effects can be felt long into adult life, affecting academic achievement, relationships and long term mental and physical health.

We encourage the children to become independent from an early age, by helping themselves to breakfast, taking responsibility for their belongings at the end of the session and helping to tidy up. The breakfast is provided by the school and the children can enjoy a range of healthy breakfast items.

Steadman and Tony eventually rented a space at the Brixton Recreation Centre, paying for it with their own money, and began working with the local disadvantaged young people, determined to use competitive sport as a way to change lives for the better.

In 2004 they set up the Afewee Academy division designed to develop the skills of those boys and girls who had the talent to become professional players
The Academy continues to thrive with boys and girls coming from far and wide in attempt to join its ranks and make the grade. It is known for its strong sense of discipline and focus amongst its young athletes.

Following years of increased demand and support to gain permanency through the work we were doing, in June 2017, we achieved our long term goal in securing a permanent space within the Brixton Recreation Centre where football, boxing and personal training sessions are offered. 

As a club we are committed to offering boxing coaching of the highest standards, accessible to all. As an organisation reflecting the realities of London society, we are a highly diverse and inclusive club, and we put a heavy emphasis on encouraging both male and female participation. Our aim is to allow all people who pass through our doors to realise their dreams and potential, encouraging hard work, dedication, respect and discipline along the way.

We believe inclusive play spaces offer a wide range of social opportunities and rich experiences that benefit disabled and non-disabled children alike.

We have a small, enthusiastic team of specialist playworkers who will support disabled children and young people at all three sites to ensure they get the most out of what we have to offer.

Oasisplay understands that finding suitable, exciting and safe provision for disabled children can be challenging so we’ve developed the Inclusion Project around what children and their families need. Our aim is to provide a quality service that’s as flexible and responsive as possible.

After School Clubs – Tuesday to Friday during term time. Times: 3.30pm to 6pm

Saturday Clubs – Every Saturday term time only. Times: 10.30am to 4pm

Holiday Playschemes – Monday to Friday throughout all school holidays (except Christmas). Times: 10.30am to 4pm.

Stay and Play – This service allows parents/carers to bring their child/young person to Oasis during any of our play sessions. Parents/carers have the opportunity to play with their child/young person within a fun and exciting play environment. The best thing about Stay and Play is that it is FREE!.

We do ask families to contact us for Stay and Play during school holidays as it can get extremely busy on site. We will do all that we can to make space for you.

Siblings – We encourage siblings of disabled children and young people to access Oasis at the same time. This allows siblings the opportunity to engage in play opportunities together but to also allow them to engage with other siblings of disabled children and young people who will have shared life experiences.

Supported Volunteering – Oasis is proud of its small and dedicated Supported Volunteer programme. We offer Volunteering opportunities across all 3 sites to young disabled people aged 15-25. Volunteers are supported throughout the day by an experienced support worker.

Children/young people wishing to join the project will first need to undergo an assessment of their needs. This will help us to determine what level of staffing support they require so we can best support them during their play.

The charity was set up in 2007 after the tragic murder of Cassandra McDermott by her ex-boyfriend. Cassandra was only 19 years old.

Our main focus is to raise more awareness about the effects of domestic abuse on young people and to educate both young men and women about the risks and signs of domestic violence and abuse and to offer much needed support to those in need of assistance.

We aim to do this by:
1.Raising awareness of domestic abuse in relationships amongst adolescents and young adults between the ages of 13 years to 25 years.
2.Informing and educating young people about their sexual rights and how to have healthier relationships.
3.Empowering young people to speak up and to seek help if they experiencing abuse in their relationships.
4.Assisting and educating young people so that they stop any abusive behaviour.
5.Providing updated information to educational services and youth centres through presentations, workshops and literature.

And as domestic abuse cuts across all barriers, there is no distinction between upbringing, age, ethnicity, social class or ability. Domestic abuse can happen to anyone so we offer support and help to survivors of domestic abuse and their families in many ways that include:
•Case work support for young people
•Counselling
•Referrals depending on need
•Risk Assessments
•Drop in sessions
•Training for professionals
•Mentoring sessions
•Coffee and chat mornings
•Homework hub
•Autism Support Group
•Workshops in schools, colleges, prisons and other settings

We are able to offer these services at our fantastic space in Norbury, SW London which has specialist rooms for counselling, one-to-one and group-work too.  We also have a dedicated space at the Centre where young people can come to get support and to relax.

In the Schoolroom we aim create a safe and engaging environment where our students can thrive educationally and heal. We aim to both scaffold and extend the learning of our students though our formal and informal curriculum. Scaffolding teaching strategies are used to encourage stronger understanding and for the majority of students a greater independence in the learning process.

Within our alternative educational provision it is particularly important to promote both an educational philosophy and practice that focusses not on a deficit model, but one that nurtures human potential and seeks out the capacities of our students. This necessitates that we actively seek to contribute to re-thinking deficit models both in the education and medical sectors.

The Foundation supports people in the community through a national network of over 30 Local Groups.  

Although dyspraxia may be diagnosed at any stage of life, increasing numbers of children are identified as having the condition.

Early recognition of dyspraxia will enable early intervention and practical steps to help your child to achieve their potential. Children whose dyspraxia is identified at an early stage are less likely to have problems with acceptance by their peers and with lowered self-esteem.

When children become teenagers their problems may change as social and organisational difficulties become more pressing.

Our service helps to settle disagreements between parents or young people and local authorities (LA’s), schools or other education providers. These disputes are often about the SEND of children and young people, and how best to meet their needs.

The provision of mediation and disagreement resolution is a statutory requirement for local authorities. It offers an alternative to a tribunal hearing and is quicker and less formal. Mediation enables people to communicate better with each other, and it can help re-build relationships that have broken down. 

This Service is for parents/carers, local authority representatives, school representatives and young people. If referrals are made by anyone other than parents, permission must be given first by the parents before contacting us.

The outreach service is a targeted provision which supports statements and Education and Health Care Plans to assess children with autism in mainstream schools. We work collaboratively with schools and parents in their continuing development to create an inclusive and autism friendly learning environment, and to enable children and young people to achieve and succeed.
The team comprises of 5 outreach teachers, one of whom leads the service. We are based at Lark Hall Primary School and Centre for Autism. All members have training, experience and specialist knowledge in autism. The team focus on early intervention by becoming involved prior to the establishment of the Education and Health Care Plan. In addition, we work closely with parents, SENCo’s and school staff to develop inclusive practice, to raise awareness of autism, and ensure that the highest level of support is in place in order to achieve success.
Where we do it:
The outreach teachers may work directly with the child or young person and advise staff through modelling, training, informing planning, target setting and providing resources. The team recognises the importance of close links with other agencies who are also involved with the child or young person such as Speech and Language Therapists and Educational Psychologists, particularly around developing and implementing strategies and interventions. We presently have links with surrounding boroughs and also support children and young people who are placed in neighbouring borough mainstream schools, living in Lambeth.

This information helps us to provide appropriate services and support.

Signing up to the Register enables us to target and direct information which is specific and relevant to your child and family's needs and interests.

Children and young people are eligible to be on the register if they are 0-18 years old, live in Lambeth, and have a special need from either a disability or a health condition, including:

•visual or hearing impairments
•physical disability
•learning disability
•long-term illness

Admission to the Base will be through the Lambeth SEND Team.

The London Nautical School is dedicated to Inclusion and is constantly developing its support structures to meet the needs of its pupils and the local community. In 2014 Lambeth SEN consulted with LNS in the setting up of a specialist ASC Resource Base, to further increase the levels of inclusion. The Autistic Spectrum Condition Resource Base opened in September 2015 with 3 students.

The ASC Provision at The London Nautical School is a unit within the school that offers help and support for children with an EHCP where the main need is Autism. Our ASC Provision team includes specialist ASC teaching assistants, a HLTA and the ASC Lead (Assistant SENCo).

We use a module based learning system so students can start at the beginning of any term and can progress at a pace that best meets their individual needs.

To apply you must have a diagnosis of an autism spectrum condition, be aged 18-25 and want to work. 

All students follow our supported internship curriculum for their first term and typically students will spend 3 terms (their first year) following this: they will learn within real work experience placements within either Guy’s or St. Thomas’ hospitals four days a week, supported by work-place mentors and specialist job coaches and attend class once a week, where they learn valuable employability and independent living skills and work towards City & Guilds qualifications. . The qualifications are both in Employability and Functional Skills. The objective is for young people to become ‘work-ready’ and to have gained a reference from their workplace.

Students’ progress to the Year two curriculum once ‘work-ready’, typically in term 4, where the focus is on greater independence in the workplace (with a wider range of employers). Students are supported to develop their interview and communication skills and to actively seek and hopefully gain paid employment, a paid apprenticeship or further vocational training of choice. In year two students access weekly 1:1 job search sessions.

TAP staff use person centred planning and our aim is to help all students reach their individual goals as defined in their Education Health and Care Plans (EHCP). Throughout the course there is a high level of 1:1 support. From September 2017 all our students will have access to our new counselling service.

In addition The Autism Project supports young people to improve their independent living skills, become involved in their community and take steps to stay healthy through enrichment activities and social groups that run across all CareTrade services. This includes local travel training.

Our ambition is to create new opportunities and choices for young people with autism. 

1 in 100 children have an autistic spectrum condition that is over 8,000 school leavers every year: 800 of them live in London. Currently less than 25% go on to further or higher education and only 15% of all adults with autism work and just 4% go on to live independently.

There is evidence that with the right support many, many more of these young people are able and would like to work and to play an active part in their community.  And for those whose autism limits their ability to become fully independent, they too need more choices and opportunities to live full and happy lives.

CareTrade founders Katharine Doré OBE and Karen Edwards are both parents of teenage autistic sons and were Founders and Trustees of Ambitious about Autism. Since the launch of our first pilot in January 2010, we have worked with over 90 young Londoners with autism. This is just the beginning.

We don’t just stop there, we research into issues facing young people today to develop our understanding of conflict and its causes. This supports policy and practice changes that have a real impact.

If you’ve been physically hurt, or feel like you are in immediate danger, call 999. The police have a duty to investigate and keep you safe.

It may help to remember that:

You are not alone. Refuge helps support many young women and teenage girls, just like you, who are experiencing abuse

The abuse is not your fault. Your partner may blame you for his behaviour – perhaps saying that you “made him hurt you” – but he alone is responsible for his actions

They will aim to provide this support as soon as you need it so that by the time your child is 5 years old, they are happy, healthy and ready for school.

- Day of game based team work, communication and teamwork training with the group, 
- Telephone support between sessions, consisting of 1 x 20 min phone call each fortnight for 16 weeks.

Using game based learning and coaching, our programmes develop the growth mind-set, resilience and self-awareness young people require to fulfil their educational potential, make intelligent choices and develop powerful aspirations for their futures.

The personal development training will use Brazilian Jiu-jitsu to learn self-defence practices, education around maintaining physical health and a positive mind set, how to diffuse violent situations and avoid conflict, mindfulness practices (which include mediation), Controlling emotions and developing empathy towards others, plus understanding personal space.  

The common outcomes of the program can be summarised as:

The complex has also returned a portion of the surrounding land back to landscaped green area.

The 3G pitch can cater for 9, 7 and 5 aside football matches and the hard court Multi-Use Games Area allows for a combination of games from netball, tennis to informal basketball. The cricket nets have been upgraded to provide a set of three new cricket nets with artificial wickets.

Refurbished changing rooms, as well as a dedicated Sports Operator management office really elevates the environment for staff and customers. Public toilets for the park users will also be housed in this building. As well as refurbished changing facilities a new community space has been created for the local community and businesses alike to host social events, and is suitable for meetings and workshops. This area will be available to book through the sports operator.

The sports complex provides floodlights for customers to use the facilities after dark. Pathway lighting from Carlisle Lane has been introduced to increase all around safety and security during the evenings with additional pathway lighting between the changing rooms and the pitches. CCTV will be in operation at all times.

The facilities provide new hard and soft landscaping, including seating for participants and spectators, cycle racks, benches, as well as ornamental trees and shrubs around the pitches interweaving the facility into the park environment.

This change amongst others gives the facility a prestigious feel which will enhance the sport offering across the borough.

A commemorative statue commissioned by the Friends of Archbishops’ Park and London Borough of Lambeth will be unveiled by the Mayor of Lambeth as part of the opening of these facilities. The statue, sculpted by the artist Jessica Wetherly, symbolises human kindness, reminds us of Lizzie Lambert who once ran a tuck shop on the site and was said to give a sixpence to local children on their birthdays.

The After School Club children have been there 3 evenings a week, allowing plenty of risky play, exploring, team games and growing fruit and vegetables.

 A very successful part of this has been the contribution of Action for London.  A group of volunteers come down 3 days a week offering drama sessions, music studio sessions and their excellent course on identity and community.  

They help the young people to work out who they are, what they want to do with their lives and the need to take responsibility for their actions and the consequences of such actions.  They also warn about the way children may be bribed into joining gangs or become runners and carry drugs.  There has been an emphasis on the dangers they may face, their own strengths and offering them techniques to resist.

Another major part of the work has been with the older girls who are particularly vulnerable to gang pressure.  This is very much built on relationships with the staff and helped by the Path Programme.  We have had an emphasis on the dangers of bullying on social media and the problems which many of them have experienced with boys expectations and explicit sexual demands. 

There is plenty of indoor and outdoor space. Youngsters grow their own fruit and vegetables. 

Would anyone interested in gardening like to come to help an prepare the ground and plant the seeds etc?   This is exactly the time of year when help is needed.

We pride ourselves on creating a unique, exciting environment that embraces all types of learners and promotes growth both academically and personally. Students and families are also welcomed into a dynamic and supportive community.

• Encourage – We here at ERS believe it is important to support children to see the joys of reading once more. In a world of ever advancing technology, even less focus is being placed on the ways in which reading is integrated into our everyday lives. We aim to revive this focus, while also stimulating their social and personal skills.

• Empower – ERS recognises that in order for children to flourish, they require institutions and organizations such as ours that will provide them with them the power to believe they can achieve whatever they wish - once they put their mind to it. We aspire to spark children’s imaginations and work ethics for them flourish in ample members of society

• Enable – Once our children have been Encouraged and Empowered, they will then be able to use what they have learnt and experienced to achieve their dreams and aspirations!
